On a tablet between approximately 880px and 1320px there are two cards in each row like shown in the following screenshot:

At the smallest viewport, between 320px and 630px, the layout changes to a single card per row. Other elements such as font sizes/padding and margin distances as well as the profile button and profile avatar change in size accordingly:
